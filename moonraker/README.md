# Moonraker - Klippy Remote API Server

## Overview

Moonraker exposes an API that can be used by web applications to
interact with Klipper.  This implementation runs outside of Klippy
as its own process.  Communcation between Klippy and the Server is
done over a Unix Domain Socket.

Moonraker's only additional dependency is Tornado.

## Installation

- Add the following remote to your Klipper git repo:
  ```
  cd ~/klipper
  git remote add arksine https://github.com/Arksine/klipper.git
  ```
- Now fetch and checkout:
  ```
  git fetch arksine
  git checkout arksine/work-web_server-20200131
  ```
  Note that you are now in a detached head state and you cannot pull. Any
  time you want to update to the latest version of this branch you must
  repeat the two commands above.

  For reference, if you want to switch back to the clone of the official repo:
  ```
  git checkout master
  ```
  Note that the above is NOT part of the Moonraker install procedure.

- If you are updating from a previous version of this branch, now is a good
  time to clean the repo using `git clean`.  First, do a dry run to see what
  will be deleted:
  ```
  cd ~/klipper
  sudo service klipper stop
  git clean -x -d -n
  ```
  It is particularly important to make sure the old `remote_api` and `web_server`
  directories are removed.  If you are ok with everything else listed (will
  mostly be *.pyc files), the following command will remove them:
  ```
  git clean -x -d -f
  ```
  It is also possible to use interactive mode and choose which files you want to
  remove:
  ```
  git clean -x -d -i
  ```

- Now you need to install the moonraker service:
  ```
  ~/klipper/scripts/install-moonraker.sh
  ```
  When the script completes it should start both Moonraker and Klipper. In
  `klippy.log` you should find the following entry:\
  `Moonraker: server connection detected`

Moonraker is responsible for creating the Unix Domain Socket, so it must be
started first for Klippy to connect.  In any instance where Klipper was
started first simply restart the klipper service.
```
sudo service klipper restart
```
After the connection is established Klippy will register API endpoints and
send configuration to the server.  Once the initial configuration is sent
to Moonraker its configuration will be retained when Klippy disconnects
(either through a restart or by stopping the service), and updated when
Klippy reconnects.

## Configuration

The host, port, log file location, and socket file location are all
specified via command arguments:
```
usage: moonraker.py [-h] [-a <address>] [-p <port>] [-s <socketfile>]
                    [-l <logfile>]

Moonraker - Klipper API Server

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a <address>, --address <address>
                        host name or ip to bind to the Web Server
  -p <port>, --port <port>
                        port the Web Server will listen on
  -s <socketfile>, --socketfile <socketfile>
                        file name and location for the Unix Domain Socket
  -l <logfile>, --logfile <logfile>
                        log file name and location
```
The default configuration is:
- address = 0.0.0.0 (Bind to all interfaces)
- port = 7125
- socketfile = /tmp/moonraker
- logfile = /tmp/moonraker.log

Like klipper, arguments can be added to the defaults file located at
`/etc/default/moonraker`. Do not change the socketfile unless you know
what you are doing.  To correctly establish communications with klipper
a change in the socket file location would require a change to
webhooks.py in the klippy host's code.

As shown above, Moonraker has its own log file located at /tmp/moonraker.log.
This file contains log entries about both the connection to Klippy and
connections to clients.

All other configuration is sent to the server via Klippy, thus it is done in
printer.cfg.  A basic configuration that authorizes clients on a range from
192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.254 is as follows:
```
[api_server]
trusted_clients:
 192.168.1.0/24
```

Below is a detailed explanation of all options currently available:
```
#[api_server]
#api_key_path: ~
#  The path to store the API Key.  Defaults to the user's home directory.
#  The file name is `.klippy_api_key`, this cannot be changed.
#require_auth: True
#  Enables Authorization.  When set to true, only trusted clients and
#  requests with an API key are accepted.
#enable_cors: False
#  Enables CORS support.  If serving static files from a different http
#  server then CORS  will need to be enabled.
#trusted_clients:
#  A list of new line separated ip addresses, or ip ranges, that are trusted.
#  Trusted clients are given full access to the API.  Note that ranges must
#  be expressed in 24-bit CIDR notation, where the last segment is zero:
#  192.168.1.0/24
#  The above example will allow 192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1-254.  Note attempting
#  to use a non-zero value for the last IP segement or different bit value will
#  result in a configuration error.
#request_timeout: 5.
#  The amount of time (in seconds) a client request has to process before the
#  server returns an error.  This timeout does NOT apply to gcode requests.
#  Default is 5 seconds.
#long_running_gcodes:
# BED_MESH_CALIBRATE, 120.
# M104, 200.
#   A list of gcodes that will be assigned their own timeout.  The list should
#   be in the format presented above, where the first item is the gcode name
#   and the second item is the timeout (in seconds).  Each pair should be
#   separated by a newline.  The default is an empty list where no gcodes have
#   a unique timeout.
#long_running_requests:
# /printer/gcode, 60.
# /printer/print/pause, 60.
# /printer/print/resume, 60.
# /printer/print/cancel, 60.
#    A list of requests that will be assigned their own timeout.  The list
#    should be formatted in the same manner as long_running_gcodes.  The
#    default is matches the example shown above.
#status_tier_1:
# toolhead
# gcode
#status_tier_2:
# fan
#status_tier_3:
# extruder
# virtual_sdcard
#  Subscription Configuration.  By default items in tier 1 are polled every
#  250 ms, tier 2 every 500 ms, tier 3 every 1s, tier 4 every 2s, tier
#  5 every 4s, tier 6 every 8s.
#tick_time: .25
#  This is the base interval used for status tier 1.  All other status tiers
#  are calculated using the value defined by tick_time (See below for more
#  information).  Default is 250ms.
```

The "status tiers" are used to determine how fast each klippy object is allowed
to be polled.  Each tier is calculated using the `tick_time` option.  There are
6 tiers, `tier_1 = tick_time` (.25s), `tier_2 = tick_time*2` (.5s),
`tier_3 = tick_time*4` (1s), `tier_4 = tick_time*8` (2s), `tier_5 = tick_time*16`
(4s), and `tier_6 = tick_time*16` (8s).  This method was chosen to provide some
flexibility for slower hosts while making it easy to batch subscription events
together.

## Websocket setup
All transmissions over the websocket are done via json using the JSON-RPC 2.0
protocol.  While the websever expects a json encoded string, one limitation
of Eventlet's websocket is that it can not send string encoded frames.  Thus
the client will receive data om the server in the form of a binary Blob that
must be read using a FileReader object then decoded.

The websocket is located at `ws://host:port/websocket`, for example:
```javascript
var s = new WebSocket("ws://" + location.host + "/websocket");
```

It also should be noted that if authorization is enabled, an untrusted client
must request a "oneshot token" and add that token's value to the websocket's
query string:

```
ws://host:port/websocket?token=<32 character base32 string>
```

This is necessary as it isn't currently possible to add `X-Api-Key` to a
websocket's request header.

The following startup sequence is recommened for clients which make use of
the websocket:
1) Attempt to connect to `/websocket` until successful using a timer-like
   mechanism
2) Once connected, query `/printer/info` (or `get_printer_info`) for the ready
   status.
   - If the response returns an error (such as 404), set a timeout for
     2 seconds and try again.
   - If the response returns success, check the result's `is_ready` attribute
     to determine if Klipper is ready.
     - If Klipper is ready you may proceed to request status of printer objects
       make subscriptions, get the file list, etc.
     - If not ready check `error_detected` to see if Klippy has experienced an
       error.
       - If an error is detected it might be wise to prompt the user.  You can
         get a description of the error from the `message` attribute
       - If no error then re-request printer info in 2s.
- Repeat step 2s until Klipper reports ready.  T
- Client's should watch for the `notify_klippy_state_changed` event.  If it reports
  disconnected then Klippy has either been stopped or restarted.  In this
  instance the client should repeat the steps above to determine when
  klippy is ready.

## API

Most API methods are supported over both the Websocket and HTTP.  File
Transfer and the "oneshot_token" request are only available over HTTP. The
Websocket is required to receive printer generated events such as gcode
responses.

Note that all HTTP responses are returned as a json encoded object in the form of:

`{result: <response data>}`

The command matches the original command request, the result is the return
value generated from the request.

Websocket requests are returned in JSON-RPC format:
`{jsonrpc: "2.0", "result": <response data>, id: <request id>}`

HTML requests will recieve a 500 status code on error, accompanied by
the specific error message.

Websocket requests that result in an error will receive a properly formatted
JSON-RPC response:
`{jsonrpc: "2.0", "error": {code: <code>, message: <msg>}, id: <request_id>}`
Note that under some circumstances it may not be possible for the server to
return a request ID, such as an improperly formatted json request.

The `www` folder includes a basic test interface with example usage for most
of the requests below.  It also includes a basic JSON-RPC implementation that
uses promises to return responses and errors (see json-rc.js).

### Get Klippy host information:
- HTTP command:\
  `GET /printer/info`

- Websocket command:\
  `{jsonrpc: "2.0", method: "get_printer_info", id: <request id>}`

- Returns:\
  An object containing the build version, cpu info, and if the Klippy
  process is ready for operation.  The latter is useful when a client connects
  after the klippy state event has been broadcast.

  `{version: "<version>", cpu: "<cpu_info>", is_ready: <boolean>,
    hostname: "<hostname>", error_detected: <boolean>,
    message: "<current state message>"}`

  `{jsonrpc: "2.0", method: "get_printer_objects", id: <request id>}`

- Returns:\
  An object containing key, value pairs, where the key is the name of the
  Klippy module available for status query, and the value is an array of
  strings containing that module's available attributes.

  ```json
  { gcode: ["busy", "gcode_position", ...],
    toolhead: ["position", "status"...], ...}
  ```

### Request currently subscribed objects:
- HTTP command:
  `GET /printer/subscriptions`

- Websocket command:\
  `{jsonrpc: "2.0", method: "get_printer_subscriptions", id: <request id>}`

- Returns:\
  An object of the similar that above, however the format of the `result`
  value is changed to include poll times:

   ```json
  { objects: {
      gcode: ["busy", "gcode_position", ...],
      toolhead: ["position", "status"...],
      ...},
    poll_times: {
      gcode: .25,
      toolhead: .25,
      ...}
    }
  ```

### Request the a status update for an object, or group of objects:
- HTTP command:\
  `GET /printer/status?gcode`

  The above will fetch a status update for all gcode attributes.  The query
  string can contain multiple items, and specify individual attributes:

  `?gcode=gcode_position,busy&toolhead&extruder=target`

- Websocket command:\
  `{jsonrpc: "2.0", method: "get_printer_status", params:
    {gcode: [], toolhead: ["position", "status"]}, id: <request id>}`

  Note that an empty array will fetch all available attributes for its key.

- Returns:\
  An object where the top level keys are the requested Klippy objects, as shown
  below:

  ```json
  { gcode: {
      busy: true,
      gcode_position: [0, 0, 0 ,0],
      ...},
    toolhead: {
      position: [0, 0, 0, 0],
      status: "Ready",
      ...},
    ...}
  ```
### Subscribe to a status request or a batch of status requests:
- HTTP command:\
  `POST /printer/subscriptions?gcode=gcode_position,bus&extruder=target`

- Returns:\
  An acknowledgement that the request has been received:

  `ok`

  The actual status updates will be sent asynchronously over the websocket.

### Run a gcode:
- HTTP command:\
  `POST /printer/gcode?script=<gc>`

  For example,\
  `POST /printer/gcode?script=RESPOND MSG=Hello`\
  Will echo "Hello" to the terminal.

- Websocket command:\
  `{jsonrpc: "2.0", method: "post_printer_gcode",
    params: {script: <gc>}, id: <request id>}`

- Websocket command:\
  `{jsonrpc: "2.0", method: "post_printer_firmware_restart", id: <request id>}`

- Returns:\
  `ok`

## File Operations

File transfer operations.  It should be that the Websocket only supports retreiving
the currrent file list.  It cannot be used to download, upload, or delete files.

### List available Virtual SDCard Files
- HTTP command:\
  `GET /printer/files`

- Websocket command:\
  `{jsonrpc: "2.0", method: "get_printer_files", id: <request id>}`

- Returns:\
  A list of objects containing file data in the following format:

```json
[
  {filename: "file name",
   size: <file size>,
   modified: "last modified date",
   ...]
```

### File Download
- HTTP command:\
  `GET /printer/files/<file_name>`

- Websocket command:\
  File Download Not Supported

- Returns:\
  The requested file

### File Upload
- HTTP command:\
  `POST /printer/files/upload`

  The file to be uploaded should be added to the FormData per the XHR spec.
  Optionally, a "print" attribute may be added to the form data.  If set
  to "true", Klippy will attempt to start the print after uploading.  Note that
  this value should be a string type, not boolean. This provides compatibility
  with Octoprint's legacy upload API.

- Websocket command:\
  File Upload Not Supported

- Returns:\
  The HTTP API returns the file name along with a successful response.

### File Delete

- HTTP command:\
  `DELETE /printer/files/<file_name>`

- Websocket command:\
  File Delete Not Supported

- Returns:\
  The HTTP request returns the name of the deleted file.

### Download klippy.log
- HTTP command:\
  `GET /printer/klippy.log`

- Websocket command:\
  Get Log Not Supported

- Returns:\
  klippy.log

### Query Endstops
- HTTP command:\
  `GET /printer/endstops`

- Websocket command:\
  `{jsonrpc: "2.0", method: "get_printer_endstops", id: <request id>}`

- Returns:\
  An object containing the current endstop state, with each attribute in the
  format of `endstop:<state>`, where "state" can be "open" or "TRIGGERED", for
  example:

```json
  {x: "TRIGGERED",
   y: "open",
   z: "open"}
```

## Authorization

Untrusted Clients must use a key to access the API by including it in the
`X-Api-Key` header for each HTTP Request.  The API below allows authorized
clients to receive and change the current API Key.

### Get the Current API Key
- HTTP command:\
  `GET /access/api_key`

- Websocket command:\
  `{jsonrpc: "2.0", method: "get_access_api_key", id: <request id>}`

- Returns:\
  The current API key

### Generate a New API Key
- HTTP command:\
  `POST /access/api_key`

- Websocket command:\
  `{jsonrpc: "2.0", method: "post_access_api_key", id: <request id>}`

- Returns:\
  The newly generated API key.  This overwrites the previous key.  Note that
  the API key change is applied immediately, all subsequent HTTP requests
  from untrusted clients must use the new key.

### Generate a Oneshot Token

Some HTTP Requests do not expose the ability the change the headers, which is
required to apply the `X-Api-Key`.  To accomodiate these requests it a client
may ask the server for a Oneshot Token.  Tokens expire in 5 seconds and may
only be used once, making them relatively for inclusion in the query string.

- HTTP command:\
  `GET /access/oneshot_token`

- Websocket command:
  Not available

- Returns:\
  A temporary token that may be added to a requests query string for access
  to any API endpoint.  The query string should be added in the form of:
  `?token=randomly_generated_token`

## Machine Operations

Machine operations are specific linux commands allowed to be run from the
Klippy host.

### Shutdown the machine
- HTTP command:\
  `POST /machine/shutdown`

- Websocket command:\
  `{jsonrpc: "2.0", method: "post_machine_shutdown", id: <request id>}`

- Returns:\
  No return value as the server will shut down upon execution

### Reboot the machine
- HTTP command:\
  `POST /machine/reboot`

- Websocket command:\
  `{jsonrpc: "2.0", method: "post_machine_reboot", id: <request id>}`

- Returns:\
  No return value as the server will shut down upon execution

## Server Commands

### Fetch stored temperature data
- HTTP command:\
  `GET /server/temperature_store`

- Websocket command:
  `{jsonrpc: "2.0", method: "get_server_temperature_store", id: <request id>}`

- Returns:\
  An object where the keys are the available temperature sensor names, and with
  the value being an array of stored temperatures.  The array is updated every
  1 second by default, containing a total of 1200 values (20 minutes).  The
  array is organized from oldest temperature to most recent (left to right).
  Note that when the host starts each array is initialized to 0s.

### Download Moonraker Log
- HTTP command:\
  `GET /server/moonraker.log`

- Websocket command:\
  Not supported

- Returns:\
  moonraker.log

## Websocket notifications
Printer generated events are sent over the websocket as JSON-RPC 2.0
notifications.  These notifications are sent to all connected clients
in the following format:

`{jsonrpc: "2.0", method: <event method name>, params: [<event state>]}`

It is important to keep in mind that the `params` value will always be
wrapped in an array as directed by the JSON-RPC standard.  Currently
all notifications available are broadcast with a single parameter.

### Gcode response:
All calls to gcode.respond() are forwarded over the websocket.  They arrive
as a "gcode_response" notification:

`{jsonrpc: "2.0", method: "notify_gcode_response", params: ["response"]}`

### Status subscriptions:
Status Subscriptions arrive as a "notify_status_update" notification:

`{jsonrpc: "2.0", method: "notify_status_update", params: [<status_data>]}`

The structure of the status data is identical to the structure that is
returned from a status request.

### Klippy Process State Changed:
The following Klippy state changes are broadcast over the websocket:
- ready
- disconnect
- shutdown

Note that Klippy's "ready" is different from the Printer's "ready".  The
Klippy "ready" state is broadcast upon startup after initialization is
complete.  It should also be noted that the websocket will be disconnected
after the "disconnect" state, as that notification is broadcast prior to a
restart. Klippy State notifications are broadcast in the following format:

`{jsonrpc: "2.0", method: "notify_klippy_state_changed", params: [<state>]}`

### File List Changed
When a client makes a change to the virtual sdcard file list
(via upload or delete) a notification is broadcast to alert all connected
clients of the change:

`{jsonrpc: "2.0", method: "notify_filelist_changed", params: [<file changed info>]}`

The <file changed info> param is an object in the following format:

```json
{action: "<action>", filename: "<file_name>", filelist: [<file_list>]}
```

The `action` is the operation that resulted in a file list change, the `filename`
is the name of the file the action was performed on, and the `filelist` is the current
file list, returned in the same format as `get_file_list`.

## Communication between Klippy and the Web Server
The server is run in its own process using Python's multiprocessing module.
Communication is done over a duplex pipe, ie a pair of "Connection" objects.
The host registers the pipe's file descriptor with the Reactor for non-blocking
reads.  Likewise the server registers its end of the pipe with Tornado's IOLoop.

## Changes vs the official repo
TODO: This is out of date, update it 
You may notice that aside from the addition of the remote_api extra, other
changes were made to support its additon. Below is a detailed list of the
changes made:
- `webhooks.py` has been added.  This module allows other host modules to
  host modules to register endpoints without trying to load the web_server
  module
- The following changes have been made to `klippy.py`:
  - The webhooks module is instantiated on printer initialization
  - The following endpoints are registered and handled:
    - /printer/info
    - /printer/restart
    - /printer/firmware_restart
  - A "klippy:post_config" event is broadcast immediately after the config
    has been read, before the unused option check.  The server uses this
    event to register all webhooks.
- The following changes have been made to `gcode.py`:
  - The webhooks module is passed into the GCodeParser's constructor. The
    the "/printer/gcode" endpoint is registered and handled by the GCodeParser
    class.
  - A "gcode:respond" event has been added.  The server uses this event to
    broadcast gcode responses over all connected websockets
  - When a write is performed on the pty, the exception handler now checks
    for errno 11 (resource not available).  If this error is found
    termios.tcflush is called to flush the output buffer.  This prevents
    an accumulation of OSErrors from logging and keeps the pty from crashing.
- `query_endstops.py` now uses the webhooks module to register the
  "/printer/endstops" endpoint
- `pause_resume.py` now uses the webhooks module to register the
  "/printer/pause", "/printer/resume", and "/printer/cancel" endpoints
- `virtual_sdcard.py` has been updated to track and report more data about
  an ongoing print.

## Todo:
- [X] Handle print requests.  Either use the virutal_sdcard, or have the
      server implement its own gcode parser. Will need to include functionality
      such as returning a file list, printing a file, uploading and downloading
      files
- [X] Support secure login for web clients
- [X] Update the websocket API to be more robust.  Currently it isn't possible
      to match requests with responses.  Clients should generate a unique id
      that accompanies each request, corresponding responses should include
      that ID.
- [X] Add "register_url" support, where Klippy extra modules can register a
      callback to be executed when an endpoint is accessed.  The request
      should also be registered with the websocket API
- [X] If possible, look into solutions that start the server with a few initial
      endpoints registered prior to the configuration being read in klippy.py.
      This would allow clients to connect and issue restart/firmware_restart
      commands in the event that the configuration is invalid.
- [X] Explore solutions for issue where the pty buffer gets full, resulting in errors
      logged each time the pty is written to.
- [X] Check to see if its possible to unload a virtual SD Card file.  Pausing
      and resetting the file position to 0 works when canceled, but the ideal
      solution would be to unload the file.
- [X] Add events for pause and resume.  Its possible that the printer could be
      paused externally, such as by a filament sensor runout.  The client can
      subscribe to the pause_resume object to recieve the current paused state
      and update itself accordingly, however it would be better to receive this
      via an event.
- [ ] Support Klippy configuration from web clients
- [X] Update Klipper's install script to include tornado deps
